I wanted to create a text prompt starting with "We flew into space and..."
Upon clicking a button that says "generate word", the program would implement a random word within the prompt and continue the story. 

The idea for this prompt was created through ChatGPT, I was curious to see how it could create a program on its own that can call back to the server API, 

The issue I am currently having is the API callback does not seem to respond after checking its status on vscode. It's possible I missed something after watching the class recording, but the second code provided (p5js>script.js) gives an example created by ChatGPT that sends a POST request to the API with the current input text and then generates and displays the output text. However, the text output has it's own issues as well.
